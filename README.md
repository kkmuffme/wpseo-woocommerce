* Analyzes the content of the short description as part of the page content.
* Throws a warning when WooCommerce is not active.

    * Adds an `@id` attribute to every individual review.

    * Adds an `isbn` attribute to the `Product` output. If an ISBN number is set, it double types the schema output to `[ Product, Book ]`. By double typing it, the Product can have the attributes of both schema.org/Book and schema.org/Product, and thus it can have an ISBN attribute and a price etc.
    * Removes the `priceValidUntil` attribute, as it's not sensible.
* OpenGraph:    
    * Adds a `product:condition` meta tag to the OpenGraph output. It defaults to `new` but can be filtered using the new `Yoast\WP\Woocommerce\product_condition` filter.
